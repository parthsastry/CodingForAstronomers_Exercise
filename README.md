# Coding for Astronomers 2021

## Collaborative Coding Exercise (Week 4)- Parth Sastry and Abhijeet Ghodgaonkar

### Repo Description

This repository will contain a simple python program to calculate and plot displacement and velocity of equation in uniform gravity. Simple 10th standard equations. The project had a lot of pull requests which was cool to get used to.
 
This is a solution to the exercise posed as part of the collaborative coding workshop in the 'Coding for Astronomers course' 2021.
